# Using `ScrollView`

Using `ScrollView` or `FlatList` inside a action sheet can become tricky because you have to handle gestures along with scrolling at the same time. I have finally been able to work out a simple solution that should work with any ScrollView based components.

The [`useScrollHandlers`](/reference/usescrollhandler) hook let's us control the `ScrollView` properly inside ActionSheets.

```tsx
import ActionSheet, {
  useScrollHandlers,
  ActionSheetRef,
  SheetProps,
} from "react-native-actions-sheet";

const ExampleSheet = (props: SheetProps) => {
  const actionSheetRef = useRef<ActionSheetRef>(null);
  const scrollHandlers = useScrollHandlers<ScrollView>(
    "scrollview-1",
    actionSheetRef
  );

  return (
    <ActionSheet ref={actionSheetRef}>
      <ScrollView {...scrollHandlers}></ScrollView>
    </ActionSheet>
  );
};
```

That's all.
