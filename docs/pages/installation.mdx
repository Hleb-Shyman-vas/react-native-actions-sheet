# Installation

Install the ActionSheet with `yarn` or `npm`. You will also need to install `react-native-gesture-handlers` if you haven't already.

```fish
npm install react-native-actions-sheet react-native-gesture-handlers --save
```

or

```fish
yarn add react-native-actions-sheet react-native-gesture-handlers 
```
